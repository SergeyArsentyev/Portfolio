## Description
```
A brief description of my project
```
A generic portfolio web-site idea that I plan to finish-up and maintain as I develop professionally and academically. The main four tabs on the site would contain:

0) The index page with a short intro. The only tab that is operational at this time!
1) My book reviews, as I read an immense amount of classics and history books. I might throw in an update on my road-trips with photos. 
2) Bio with my life itinerary. I have lived in 3 states, 2 countries, attended multiple universities, worked a variety of trades. A rolling stone gathers no moss.
3) Academic and professional information, potentially with samples of my work in PDF.
4) Email, LinkedIn information.



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:
1. .body  - sets left padding at 5px and the rest at 0;
	sets the flex display of the page div's with total height 100% of the screen - to make sure the footer stays where it belongs, and not somewhere in the middle.

2. .main-photo - establishes the position (center, with vertical margins of 25px) and the round shape of the photograph.

3. .intro:first-letter  - as a big bookworm, I think firstletters are cool.

4. .header, .footer, .main - with border and background settings

5. nav a  - with responsive flex parameters 

6. .acknoledgements  - margins and a smaller font size

..and a few others, such as paragraphs with IDs, headers, etc.



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:
1. function name:  addEventListener
	the function hides the photograph upon a click on the button, and prints a fun fact about the author.
